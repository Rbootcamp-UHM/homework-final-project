# homework-final-project

## Congratulations on getting to the end of the semester! 

**For your final project**, choose any data analysis project where you can show off your programming skills. You are encouraged to analyze your own data to further your research, but you choose anything you like. You can reanalyze published data, obtain data from someone else, or simulate data. 

*Your analysis must be conducted entirely in R*, with appropriate graphics produced. (If you need to do some tasks in other software, that's fine, but only the R portion will count toward your grade). Source code, graphics, and a short write up (very brief intro, analysis/results, brief discussion of interpretation of the data/conclusions) should be turned in. In addition, students should present their analysis in the last week in a brief presentation (10 min max).

**Grading:** The final project will constitute 25% of your final grade, and will be graded in three parts: the code, a short paper, and an in class presentation, with about half the weight given to the code (so roughly 50%, 25%, 25%). 

**Paper:** A short write-up with: 
 - a very brief intro leading to a statement of the problem
 - description of the data and strategies or methods used
 - analysis/results/graphics
 - brief discussion/interpretation of the data and conclusions
 There is no specific length requirement but 3-5 pages getting straight to the main ideas would be great. No fluff please. 
 
 **Talk:** 10 min in-class presentation:
 - 2 min intro ending with a clear statement of the problem
 - 1-2 min methods explaining strategy
 - 3-5 min results - what did you do and what did you find? **Show off here**
 - 1 min conclusions/final thoughts/wrap-up
 
**Code:**
Your code should demonstrate mastery of programming for data analysis or visualization. An 'A' project will demonstrate substantial effort (consider that your 8 homeworks count for 50% of your grade). Creativity and intellectual effort are always highly prized. 

**Submission:** Upload your code and any data to this repository. It should run from source and generate all graphics and output files that were included in/support your paper and talk. Please upload your paper to this repository too. 

**Due Dates:**
Paper and code are due by midnight, May 3rd.
